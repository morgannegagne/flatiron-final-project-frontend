## Herd

Herd is a fullstack web application that allows users to save places to a personal map, add friends, and see their friends saved placed. It is a social way to discover new shops, restaurants, and attractions.

The frontend utilizes React/Redux to build components and is styled using Semantic UI and custom CSS.

Places and maps were served through the Google Maps API.
