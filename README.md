## Herd

Herd is a fullstack web application that allows users to save places to a personal map, add friends, and see their friends saved places. It is a social way to discover new shops, restaurants, and attractions.

The frontend utilizes React/Redux to build components and is styled using Semantic UI and custom CSS.

Places and maps were served through the Google Maps API. 

The backend was built using Ruby on Rails. [Backend Repository](https://github.com/morgannegagne/flatiron-final-project-backend)

Here is a [demo video](https://youtu.be/U2yXSjJMqdA). 




### Custom Google Chrome Extension
This project also includes a custom Google Chrome extension that allows users to save places from anywhere in the web. The Chrome Extension makes a POST request to a Rails backend, where Nokogiri is utilized to scrape the web page, looking for a place name or address. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/morgannegagne/flatiron-final-project-chrome-extension).
